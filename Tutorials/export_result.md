# 4. Export data analysis

This tutorial describes the output table of the analysis results. You can copy/save the values in the table for further analysis.

Once the batch analysis is complete, the output results is displayed in a table format. Each row is the value of a electrical property and each column is a data file. You can also transpose the table by clicking the “:repeat:” button.

To export and save the table, click the “Save the table” button. A save dialog will appear and the table can be save in .xlsx, .xls, .xlsm, .txt, and .csv format. The default file name is “yyyymmdd_hhmmss_pilelabel”.
