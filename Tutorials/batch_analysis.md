This tutorial describes how to perform the batch analysis in ElecFeX. Here you can specify the electrical properties to be measured from which sweep(s) and which spike(s) from the selected files.

1. **Specify the sweep(s) and spike(s).** Type in the sweep(s) and spike(s) to measure the electrical properties, such as 1, 2, 5-7.
2. **Select the electrical properties.** Click the checkbox to select the electrical properties to be measured from the data file.
3. **Click the “Process the analysis for all selected files” button. ** This will open a dialog to confirm your selection and settings. If confirmed, a progress bar will appear during the process and a dialog will the appear when the analysis is complete.
