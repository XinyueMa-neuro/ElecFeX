# Tutorials

This tutorial is an introduction that guides you through the steps of using ElecFeX. 

The ElecFeX Tutorial is split into four parts, covering each four panels of the main window of ElecFeX:

1. [Load data files](load_data.md)
2. [Extract electrical properties](extract_feature.md)
3. [Batch analysis](batch_analysis.md)
4. [Export results](export_result.md)

You can click the hyperlink above to access the tutorials that guide you through each four panels in detail. 

We also provided several examples to showcase how you can work on the ElecFeX’s output, such as statistical comparison and clustering: see [Example analysis on the ElecFeX’s output](https://github.com/XinyueMa-neuro/ElecFeX-MaEtAl2024).
